# Why Shenzhen Shunchuang and Shunde Angel Co-investment Resemble the Northern Myanmar Pig Butchering Scam

After delving into the behavior of Shenzhen Shunchuang Industry Accelerator and Shunde Angel Co-investment, it is evident that these institutions are not fostering innovation and entrepreneurship as they claim. Instead, they engage in predatory behavior hidden behind meticulously designed contracts, showing high similarities with the notorious Pig Butchering Scam in Northern Myanmar:

## 1. Deceptive Promises Versus Actual Behavior
This strategy is a well-designed "double-win" game for the institutions. When guiding Shenzhen Chaosuan to relocate, the Shunde Technology Bureau promised technological innovation support. However, once relocated, it turned out to be a trap of increased rent followed by subsidies and was not supported as initially promised. Despite this, they designed a wide range of high-interest repurchase terms to ensure high returns under any circumstances. By building trust through propaganda and government endorsement, they lure entrepreneurs into the game and then unscrupulously tear all promises, leaving the businesses in dire straits. This is not only a betrayal of entrepreneurs and partners but also a systematic fraud, sharing the same deceitful nature as the Northern Myanmar Pig Butchering Scam.

## 2. Verbal Support Versus Actual Action
In public and in the media, these institutions might claim to be guardians and supporters of entrepreneurs. However, in reality, they lack action or capacity to support, acting more like rent collectors or real estate agents, far detached from fostering innovation. Despite verbal support, these institutions fail to fulfill their promises, causing Shenzhen Chaosuan to miss significant development opportunities. When the company is ready for equity change and new development, these institutions suddenly change stance, claiming complete ignorance of the equity changes and demanding high repurchase of shares, similar in deceit to the ever-changing conditions of the Pig Butchering Scam. This strategy ensures low to no risk profit for themselves, shifting all risk to the entrepreneurs and companies, completely disregarding the dreams and efforts of the entrepreneurs, nearly indistinguishable in secrecy and cunning from the Pig Butchering Scam.

## 3. Exploiting Contractual Loopholes to Exert Financial Pressure
This represents a deeper issue: systematic exploitation of the vulnerable. When businesses choose to leave, these institutions not only withhold deposits but also demand up to 8.2 million RMB in repurchase fees, disregarding the pandemic hardships faced by the businesses. By creating or exploiting crisis moments to exert financial pressure, their actions are highly reminiscent of the Pig Butchering Scam's method of pressuring victims when they are most helpless. Through complex contractual designs, these institutions skirt the edges of legality to legitimize their actions. This exploitative strategy not only destroys businesses but also harms the entire business ecosystem's health, mirroring the Pig Butchering Scam's exploitation of victims in their most desperate moments.

## 4. Covertly Altering Contract Content to Demand Unreasonable Returns
This behavior reflects the institutions' cold-heartedness. They exploit the vulnerability of businesses and strike when they need support the most. Despite lengthy negotiations with Shenzhen Chaosuan and initial verbal support, they ultimately demand high repurchase of shares for various reasons, continuously altering their statements to achieve high buybacks after being refuted by Shenzhen Chaosuan. This behavior reflects a deliberate destruction of entrepreneurial spirit, with the same destructive nature as the continuous deception by the Pig Butchering Scam.

## 5. Proposing Harsh and Unfair Settlement Conditions
This action reflects the extreme self-interest of the institutions, with contracts imposing no constraints on them. Even if the businesses pay the complete share repurchase amount, if the institutions fail to cooperate with contractual terms, the businesses end up paying the penalty to the institutions. They not only refuse to acknowledge their mistakes but also impose unfair conditions, further pushing businesses to the brink. This not only lacks business ethics but is also a blatant challenge to the principles of rule of law, similar in essence to the Pig Butchering Scam's method of continuously raising the stakes in exploitation of the vulnerable.

## 6. Utilizing State Capital Status to Dominate Over Founding Team and Other Shareholders
This behavior reveals the complexities and potential risks brought by state capital intervention in the equity structure of private enterprises. Companies do not receive any substantial support, instead facing multiple relocations due to the institutions' issues, severely impacting operations and stability. In post-investment management, state-owned shareholders lack an assessment and understanding of technological development, leading to no substantial help for the companies. Even amid difficulties, these institutions still worry about their own risks, demanding unreasonable solutions, completely ignoring the principles of modern business civilization and laws which require all shareholders to bear risks and responsibilities together. This is very similar to the Pig Butchering Scam's manipulation of victims through fabricated networks to control and ultimately plunder properties.

In conclusion, Shenzhen Shunchuang Industry Accelerator and Shunde Angel Co-investment's behavior not only allegedly violates business ethics and social responsibilities but also shows shocking similarities with the fraud tactics of the Pig Butchering Scam in many aspects. These actions have broken the trust between investors and entrepreneurs, severely hindering the healthy development of the entire innovation ecosystem.
